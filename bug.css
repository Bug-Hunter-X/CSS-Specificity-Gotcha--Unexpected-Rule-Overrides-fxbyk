The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is overridden by the following rule */
}

div p:first-child {
  color: yellow; /* This is more specific and overrides the previous rule */
}
```

The problem arises due to the unexpected behavior of specificity. Although the `div p` rule targets `p` elements within `div` elements, the `div p:first-child` rule has higher specificity because of the `:first-child` pseudo-class.  This can be counterintuitive if one expects the closest ancestor rule to always win.
