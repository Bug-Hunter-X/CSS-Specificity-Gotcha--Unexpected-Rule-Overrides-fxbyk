One solution is to be mindful of CSS specificity and use more precise selectors.  Another approach is to reorder rules, or add `!important` (use sparingly!), but this is less ideal for maintainability.

Here's an improved approach:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

/*More explicit selector to avoid specificity conflict*/
div > p {
  color: green;
}

div > p:first-child {
  color: yellow; 
}

/*Consider using classes for better control*/
div.container p {
    color: purple; 
}
```
By using more precise selectors, you have more control over which styles are applied and avoid unexpected overrides due to the pseudo-classes.
